# recursive-maze-solver
A simple maze solver implemented using pure recursion and DFS (Depth First Search)

### Features
- Recursive depth-first search
- Path tracking with backtracking
- Cycle prevention using visited set

### Why recursion?
This project was written to understand recursion and backtracking in grid-based problems.

### Limitations
- Not optimized for shortest path
- No global variable
- Uses DFS instead of BFS

### Note: Running tests
Run: python -m tests.test_basic
